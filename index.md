# Privacy Policy — Valyo

**Effective date:** [2026-02-17]

Valyo (“the App”) helps users compare grocery prices and manage budgets. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 1) Data we collect
Depending on how you use the App, we may collect:

- **Device and app identifiers** (e.g., a device identifier used for app functionality and request security).
- **Approximate location** (only if you grant location permission) to show nearby stores and distance-based sorting.
- **App activity and usage data** (e.g., screens viewed, feature usage) to improve the App.
- **Diagnostics** (e.g., crash logs, performance data) to keep the App reliable.
- **Purchase/budget entries you create** (stored on your device and/or on our servers depending on the feature).

The App currently shows any receipt-scanning entry points as **“Coming soon”**. If receipt scanning is enabled in a future version, this policy will be updated.

## 2) How we use data
We use data to:
- Provide core functionality (price comparison, budgeting features).
- Improve performance and fix bugs.
- Prevent abuse and protect the service.
- Show ads in the Free tier (if enabled).

## 3) Ads and analytics
The Free tier may display ads. Ad providers may collect or receive certain identifiers and diagnostics to serve and measure ads.

We may also use analytics/crash reporting services to understand performance and improve stability.

## 4) Data sharing
We may share limited data with:
- **Service providers** (hosting, analytics, crash reporting).
- **Ad partners** (to deliver and measure ads in the Free tier).

We do not sell personal data.

## 5) Data retention
We retain data only as long as needed for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required by law.

## 6) Security
We use reasonable safeguards to protect data, including encryption in transit where applicable.

## 7) Your choices
- You can **deny location permission**; nearby-store features may be reduced.
- You can uninstall the App to stop data collection from the App.

## 8) Children
Valyo is not directed to children under 13.

## 9) Contact
If you have questions or requests, contact:
- **Email:** [your support email]
- **Website:** [optional website link]

## 10) Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page with a new effective date.
