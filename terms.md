## 1) What Valyo does
Valyo provides price comparison and budgeting tools for users in Malaysia. Prices shown may come from public sources and/or user submissions. Valyo is provided for informational purposes only.

---

## 2) Eligibility
You must comply with applicable laws and app store rules. Valyo is intended for general audiences.

---

## 3) No accounts (MVP/closed beta)
Valyo may operate without user accounts during MVP/closed beta. The App may use a device identifier to provide core functionality and enforce limits (e.g., anti-abuse measures).

---

## 4) User content and submissions
You may be able to submit information (e.g., prices, product suggestions, receipts OCR output, feedback) (“Submissions”).

You agree that:
- Your Submissions are accurate to the best of your knowledge.
- You will not submit illegal, misleading, harmful, or infringing content.
- You will not abuse the App (spam submissions, manipulate prices, automated scraping, etc.).

**License to use Submissions:** You grant Valyo a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and display your Submissions for operating and improving the App (including data aggregation and quality controls). You retain ownership of your Submissions.

---

## 5) Data accuracy and disclaimers
Prices and availability:
- may be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect,
- may differ from in-store or checkout prices,
- may change without notice.

Valyo does not guarantee any specific savings or outcome. You are responsible for verifying prices and product details before purchasing.

## 6) Prohibited conduct
You may not:
- reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code except where permitted by law,
- interfere with or disrupt the App or servers,
- attempt to bypass paywalls, limits, ads/entitlements, or security controls,
- use automated means to access or scrape the App without permission,
- submit malicious code, fraudulent content, or impersonate others.

We may suspend or restrict access for abuse or violations.

---

## 7) Premium, subscriptions, and purchases
Valyo may offer paid tiers (e.g., Ad-Free, Premium). Purchases and subscriptions are handled by the relevant app store and subject to its terms.

If you buy a subscription:
- billing and renewal are managed by the app store,
- cancellation is handled through your app store account settings,
- refunds are subject to the app store’s policies.

Features and entitlements may be enforced server-side.

## 8) Advertising
Free tier may display ads. Ads are shown according to in-app entitlements and App configuration. Sponsored content will be labeled.

---

## 9) Third-party services
Valyo may rely on third-party services (e.g., maps links, analytics, ads, public data sources). Their terms and privacy policies may apply to your use of those services.

We are not responsible for third-party services, content, or availability.

---

## 10) Intellectual property
Valyo and its logos, branding, and software are owned by us or our licensors and protected by applicable laws. You may not use our branding without permission.

---

## 11) Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us the right to use them without restriction or compensation.

---

## 12) Privacy
Your use of Valyo is also governed by our Privacy Policy:  
**https://github.com/valyoapp-max/valyo-privacy/blob/main/index.md**

If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy on a privacy matter, the Privacy Policy controls.

---

## 13) Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- Valyo is provided “as is” and “as available”.
- We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of profits/data, arising from your use of the App.

Our total liability for any claim related to the App will not exceed the amount you paid us (if any) in the 3 months before the claim.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.

---

## 14) Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Valyo harmless from claims arising out of:
- your Submissions,
- your misuse of the App,
- your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

---

## 15) Changes to the App or Terms
We may update the App and these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms with a new effective date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

---

## 16) Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if we discontinue the App. Sections that by nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitation of liability) will survive termination.

---

## 17) Governing law
These Terms are governed by the laws of **Malaysia**, without regard to conflict of law principles.
